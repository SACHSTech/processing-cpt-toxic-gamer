# Kirby Hunt

Kirby hunt is a first person shooting game. It is inspired and strongly influenced by the classic arcane shooting game, Duck Hunt, that, it’s background image is used as this game’s map. The gameplay of the Kirby Hunt is quite similar to the classic Nintendo arcane. Even so, there is a significant difference between the two: while duck hunt is a game that shoots duck, in Kirby hunt, as judged by its title, the players shoot Kirbys. When Kirby hunt is launched, the timer starts to countdown from one minute. As long as the timer is active, Kirbys will run out from the edges in different moving patterns and with randomized starting point and directions. They will attempt to reach the other side of the screen. In order to stop them, you must aim with your mouse and click to shoot at them. If you successfully shoot a Kirby, it will die and you will score a point from that. Your current score will be constantly displayed at the top left corner of the screen. On the top right corner, a timer is displayed and shows how much time is left. When the time remaining hits 20, the meta knight, whom had been standing on the tree facing backwards(note that you will not be able to attack the meta knight unless he starts gliding), will turn around and jumps off from the tree. Then, he will glide away from the screen. However, if you shoot the meta knight before he gets away from the map, he will die and that grants you 10 points! When the time runs out, The screen will be cleared immediately and only the background image will be left over. An ending screen will be displayed, including a classic Mario-themed “GAME OVER” that will be shown on the centre of the screen and your total score will be displayed right below it.
